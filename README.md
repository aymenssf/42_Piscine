# 42_Piscine
42 is the first computer programming school, offering a completely free program that is open 24/7 and accessible to everyone, regardless of prior knowledge or academic qualifications. It provides a comprehensive immersion into an environment where the future is already present.
The teaching philosophy at 42 is based on peer learning, a collaborative approach that enables students to unleash their creativity through project-based learning. To train the coders of tomorrow, it was necessary to rethink the learning process and make computer programming something fun, exciting, and far removed from the restrictive vision that the general public may have.
42 is a school of the present, focused on the future

# The Pool
The "pool" is a 4-week immersion in the coding world. Just like a marathon runner, you will take a deep dive. Every day, weekends included during a month, you will be working on IT projects. At the same time, you get to know fellow applicants, submit and evaluate projects. The “pool” program is like a fresh start. An opportunity to start a new and no need to have IT knowledge to start. The only prerequisite… is to know how to use a computer.
